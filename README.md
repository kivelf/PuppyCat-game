Welcome to **The PuppyCat Game**! This is the first game I'm making in Pygame, and it has been a wonderful learning experience. Here are some highlights and important notes about the game:

## Highlights
- **Realistic Gravity and Animations**: The game features somewhat realistic gravity, making the player character's movements more lifelike. The sprites are animated by slicing images from sprite sheets, adding a smooth and visually appealing dynamic to the game.
- **Custom Graphics**: All the graphics in the game, including the backgrounds, blocks, and traps, were created by me using the animated sprite editor & pixel art tool **Aseprite**. I wanted to give the game a unique and personal touch through custom art.
- **Inspired by Bee and Puppycat**: The character in the game, *Puppycat*, is inspired by and is the property of **Natasha Allegri**. This game is *a fan-made project* and respects the original creator's copyright!

## Current Status
The game is in its very early stages. Here is an initial to-do list that outlines the features and improvements I plan to implement:

1. **Extend the Level**: Add more blocks and traps to expand the gameplay experience.
2. **Lives/Health System**: Implement a system where the player has multiple lives or health points.
3. **Health Replenishment**: Add items like fruit or gems that can replenish the player's health.
4. **Score System**: Implement a system to track the player's score based on their performance.
5. **Music and SFX**: Add background music and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
6. **Title and End Screens**: Create a title screen for the start of the game and an end screen for when the player dies.

## Getting Started
To run the game, make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can start the game by running the `main.py` file. Additionally, I've made an executable version (v1.0) of the game for easier access. You can simply download and run the executable without needing to install Python and Pygame.

Thank you for checking out The PuppyCat Game! Stay tuned for more updates and features. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome as I continue to learn and improve this project.

### ✨ Happy gaming! ✨
